# Client (Expo React Native)

## Setup
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. Start: `npm start` (expo dev tools)

## Notes
- Update `API_BASE` in `client/screens/ListScreen.js` to point to your server (if using a device, use your machine IP).
- For device testing, ensure server is reachable on the network.
