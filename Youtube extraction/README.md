# NLP YouTube Metadata Project (Server + Expo Client)

This repository contains a ready-to-run scaffold for the Learnoverse internship assignment:
- server/: Node.js + Express server that stores only `videoId`s in MongoDB and returns enriched metadata from the YouTube Data API.
- client/: Expo React Native app that lists videos and plays them **inside the app** using WebView embed.

IMPORTANT:
- Replace the placeholders for `MONGODB_URL` and `YT_API_KEY` before running.
- Do NOT commit real credentials to a public repo. Use private repo or redact if required.
